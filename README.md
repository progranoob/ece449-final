# ece449-final
This is the final project of our ece449. My partner, Yichen Li, and I worked closely for weeks and finally got reasonable results.
Before reading specific codes, I'd like to recommend you to first read the PPT first, so that you can get a rough understanding of what we have done.
In this project, we first implemented the basic CNN structure to train standard datasets from CIFS, then the dataset given by professor, which has about 10% error labels.
Next, we searched from the Internet and found a possible solution, named Pencil and tried to use this structure to optimize our accuracy. However, the actual performance is not as good as we expect, so we finally came up with several feasible advice to further improve the results.
